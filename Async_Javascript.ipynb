        "Question:\n",
        "  Write an example to show that JavaScript is single-threaded by creating two competing tasks, one that blocks the event loop and another async function that waits for a promise.\n",
        "- Javascript is single-threaded which can be evaluated by given code example. First it register a promise with takes 5 seconds to resolve. Then it starts a massive for loops which makes the tread busy for approx 10 seconds. So the promise resolve handler waits till the for loop finishes it work. It proves that javascript is single threaded, have only onle call stack and only one event loop.\n",

        " Question:\n",
        " JavaScript is often called synchronous and single-threaded, yet it handles asynchronous tasks like AJAX  requests, timers, and event listeners\n",
        "  * a. Explain why JavaScript does not execute asynchronously by default\n",
        "  * b. Write a code snippet to prove that JavaScript is inherently synchronous\n",
        "\n",
        "-  * a. Javascript can't execute asynchronously but it can handle asynchronous tasks like AJAX requests, timers etc. Its due to all these functionality is provided by runtime, these are not javascript's native feature, It's handled by runtime eviornment's like browsers, Node etc. They run a timer on their own and notify javascript after the timer finishes. Runtime get the data from the server through AJAX. Then give it to javascript to finish it work.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * b. Below code proves that javascript is inherently synchronous. Where i started a timer of 0s which should be finished as soon as it starts but its getting delayed due to a for loop going on which blocked the thread.\n",

        "- There are 3 different states in promised. i. Pending ii. Resolved iii. Rejected.\n",
        "  * i. Pending: This is the running state of promise when promise doing its job like getting data from server or something else. This is the default state of promise when its get created.\n",
        "  * ii. Resolved: This is the state when a promise completes its job without any errors. we have to call a function resolve to make the promise to go in this state otherwise it will be in Pending state forever.\n",
        "  * iii. Rejected: This is the state when a promise is finised with some error. We can make a promise to come in this state by calling reject function.\n",

        "- The JavaScript event loop treats Promises and setTimeout differently by placing them in different queues: Promises (and queueMicrotask) are added to the microtask queue. setTimeout, setInterval, setImmediate, etc. are placed in the macrotask queue (also called the task queue). So, if both setTimeout and promise handler is waiting, Promise handler will execute first then settimeout callback. It can be proved by given code example:\n",
